# Releasing SearchSocket

Publishing is fully automated: pushing a `v*` tag to GitHub triggers
`.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which typechecks, builds, tests, and runs
`pnpm publish --provenance --access public` using NPM Trusted Publishing (OIDC).
**There is no NPM token anywhere** — nothing to configure, but also nothing to
fall back on if the workflow itself breaks.

Your job is everything that happens before that tag exists, and verifying what
happens after.

## Non-negotiables

- **Never commit directly to `main`.** It only ever receives `--no-ff` merges
  from `release/*` or `hotfix/*`, plus the tag.
- **The tag lives on `main`**, created after the merge, never on `develop` or on
  the release branch.
- **A published version is permanent.** NPM refuses to republish a version
  number, even after `npm unpublish`. If a release is bad, the fix is always the
  *next* patch version, never a re-tag.
- **Push the tag last.** `git push origin main` alone publishes nothing; the tag
  push is the trigger. Push main first so the tagged commit is already reachable.
- **Attribution**: commit messages and release notes never mention Claude, AI,
  or generated content.

## Step 1 — Preflight

```bash
pwd
git status --porcelain          # must be empty
git branch --show-current       # must be develop (or main for a hotfix)
git fetch origin
git log --oneline origin/develop..develop   # must be empty
git log --oneline develop..origin/develop   # must be empty
node -p "require('./package.json').version"
git describe --tags --abbrev=0
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..develop --oneline
```

Stop and report if the tree is dirty, the branch is wrong, or local and origin
have diverged. Do not stash or auto-commit stray changes — that is the user's
call.

Also confirm `main` is not ahead of `develop` in a way that would be lost
(`git log --oneline develop..origin/main`). If it is, merge main into develop
first and stop for review.

## Step 2 — Choose the version

If the user passed an explicit bump or version, use it. Otherwise read every
commit since the last tag and apply Conventional Commits:

- `BREAKING CHANGE:` in a body, or `!` after the type (`feat!:`) → **major**
  (while `0.x`, a breaking change is a **minor** bump)
- any `feat:` → **minor**
- otherwise → **patch**

State the detected bump and the resulting version before acting on it. If
nothing has landed since the last tag, say so and stop.

## Step 3 — Cut the release branch

```bash
git switch -c release/0.8.0 develop
```

For a hotfix (an urgent fix on top of what is already published, skipping
whatever is unreleased on develop):

```bash
git switch -c hotfix/0.7.2 main
```

Everything after this point is identical for both, except the branch name.

## Step 4 — Bump the version

```bash
npm version 0.8.0 --no-git-tag-version
```

This edits `package.json` only. It does **not** touch the CHANGELOG (do that by
hand, next) and does not tag or commit. `pnpm-lock.yaml` does not record the
root package version, so `--frozen-lockfile` in CI stays happy.

## Step 5 — Write the CHANGELOG entry

`CHANGELOG.md` follows Keep a Changelog. Insert a new section directly above the
previous version's heading:

```markdown
## [0.8.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
```

Rules that matter here:

- Use today's real date (`date +%F`), not a guess.
- Drop any section with no entries.
- Write for someone who uses the package, not someone who reads the diff. One
  line per user-visible change; collapse the churn.
- Prefix genuinely breaking changes with `**Breaking:**` under `### Changed`.
- Mention the affected entry point when a change is scoped to one
  (`searchsocket/svelte`, `searchsocket/sveltekit`, the CLI).

## Step 6 — Validation gate

All four must pass. Any failure stops the release on the release branch, where
the fix can be committed before continuing.

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
npm pack --dry-run
```

`npm pack --dry-run` is not optional theatre. The `./svelte` subpath ships **raw
source**, not bundled output, so it can silently break when an import is added
to `src/svelte/*`. Check the file list for:

- `dist/` present, `dist/**/*.map` absent
- `src/svelte/` present
- **every non-`src/svelte` file that `src/svelte/*` imports at runtime** is also
  in the tarball (currently `src/types.ts` and `src/utils/structured-meta.ts`)

If `src/svelte` gained a new relative import, add that file to `files` in
`package.json` before releasing. This exact gap shipped broken in v0.7.1.

The build output goes to stdout and will corrupt any attempt to pipe
`npm pack --dry-run` into a JSON parser — read the `npm notice` lines instead.

## Step 7 — Commit and push the release branch

```bash
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: prepare for v0.8.0 release"
git push -u origin release/0.8.0
```

Pushing the branch lets CI run the Node 20/22/24 matrix against the exact commit
that is about to become the tag. Wait for it:

```bash
gh run watch --exit-status
```

If CI is red here, fix it on the release branch. Nothing has been tagged or
published yet, so this is a free checkpoint.

## Step 8 — Merge to main and tag

```bash
git switch main
git merge --no-ff release/0.8.0 -m "chore: release v0.8.0"
git tag -a v0.8.0 -m "Release version 0.8.0"
git push origin main
git push origin v0.8.0
```

The tag push starts the publish workflow. Watch it:

```bash
gh run watch --exit-status
```

## Step 9 — Merge back to develop

Do this even if the publish is still running — `develop` must carry the version
bump and the CHANGELOG entry, and for a hotfix it must carry the fix itself.

```bash
git switch develop
git merge --no-ff release/0.8.0 -m "chore: merge release v0.8.0 back into develop"
git push origin develop
git push origin --delete release/0.8.0
git branch -d release/0.8.0
```

## Step 10 — Verify and announce

```bash
npm view searchsocket version          # must equal the released version
npm view searchsocket dist-tags
```

Then publish the GitHub release using the CHANGELOG section as the body:

```bash
gh release create v0.8.0 --title "v0.8.0" --notes "<the CHANGELOG section>"
```

Report to the user: the version, the NPM URL
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/searchsocket), the publish run's status, and the
headline changes.

## When the publish workflow fails

The tag already exists on `main` and cannot be reused for a different artifact.

- **Failed before publishing** (typecheck/build/test/OIDC error, nothing on NPM —
  confirm with `npm view searchsocket version`): fix the cause on a `hotfix/*`
  branch off `main`, then re-run the workflow against the existing tag with
  `gh run rerun <run-id>` **only if** the tagged tree itself is fine and the
  failure was infrastructural. If the tagged tree needs to change, cut the next
  patch version instead — never move a tag that has been pushed.
- **Failed after publishing**: the version is live. Roll forward with a new
  patch release. Do not `npm unpublish`; it blocks the version number for good
  and breaks anyone who already installed it.
- **OIDC/Trusted Publishing errors** (`403`, "provenance", "trusted publisher"):
  the NPM side expects the `publish.yml` workflow from `gregpriday/searchsocket`
  specifically. Renaming the workflow file, the repo, or the job breaks it, and
  it can only be repaired in NPM's package settings — not in this repo.

## Reference

- `main` — production, tags only, protected by convention.
- `develop` — default branch, integration target for `feature/*`.
- `release/*` — from `develop`, merges to **both** `main` and `develop`.
- `hotfix/*` — from `main`, merges to **both** `main` and `develop`.
- Branch prefixes are stored in git config: `git config --get-regexp '^gitflow\.'`
- CI (`ci.yml`) runs typecheck → build → test on Node 20/22/24; publish uses
  Node 24. Keep the matrix in step with `engines.node` (`>=20.19.0`).
- This repo *is* the `searchsocket` package, so its own bin is never linked into
  `node_modules/.bin`. Invoke the CLI as `node dist/cli.js`, never
  `pnpm searchsocket` — the latter only appears to work on a machine with a
  global install.
