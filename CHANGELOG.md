# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Redesigned search UI templates.** `searchsocket add` now generates a polished,
  self-contained command palette instead of a minimal Tailwind sketch. Each
  template directory ships the component plus `SearchResultRow.svelte`,
  `search-ui.ts` and `search-theme.css`, and nothing imports back into
  `node_modules` — the generated code is entirely yours.
- **No CSS framework required.** Styling is plain CSS driven by semantic
  `--ss-search-*` variables, so the default works in any SvelteKit project.
  Tailwind still works if you want it; the templates simply no longer depend
  on it.
- **Explicit theme modes.** A `theme` prop accepts `inherit` (default, follows
  the host app's `.dark` / `[data-theme="dark"]` convention), `system`, `light`
  and `dark`, and sets `color-scheme` to match. Plus a `density` prop, `class`
  and `style` forwarding, and stable `.ss-search__*` part classes documented as
  the styling escape hatch.
- **Richer results.** Rows now show the best matching section and a URL
  breadcrumb alongside the title and snippet, so a result explains *why* it
  matched. `SearchResults` can list matching sections as their own
  scroll-to-text links, and supports `list` and `cards` variants.
- **Search options as props.** `topK`, `scope`, `pathPrefix`, `tags`, `filters`,
  `groupBy`, `maxSubResults`, `debounce`, `cache` and `minQueryLength` are props
  on `SearchDialog` and `SearchInput` rather than hard-coded internals. Changing
  a scope or filter re-runs the current query without recreating the store.
- **`searchsocket add search-trigger`** — the visible button that opens the
  dialog. A keyboard shortcut alone is not discoverable.
- **`createSearch()` gains `status`, `resolvedQuery`, `hasSearched`, `clear()`
  and `retry()`**, plus `minQueryLength` and `keepPreviousResults` options. All
  additive: existing `query`/`results`/`loading`/`error`/`destroy()` behaviour
  and defaults are unchanged, the request body is unchanged, and the cache is
  still keyed on the query exactly as typed. The published `SearchState`
  interface is untouched — the new members live on a `SearchStore` interface
  that extends it, so code annotating or implementing `SearchState` still
  compiles.
- `onSelectError` on `SearchDialog` and `SearchInput`, so a rejected `onSelect`
  or `navigate` surfaces instead of becoming an unhandled rejection.

### Fixed

- Template components no longer use fixed DOM ids (`ss-listbox`, `ss-option-0`),
  which collided when a page had two search inputs, or a dialog and an inline
  input together. Ids are derived per instance and can be pinned with `id`.
- The dialog now traps `Tab` inside itself, restores focus to the element that
  opened it, and restores the previous `body` overflow value instead of clearing
  it — a page setting its own `overflow` no longer loses it on close.
- The active result is scrolled into view during arrow navigation instead of
  moving out of the visible list.
- `Enter` is ignored while an IME composition is active, so committing CJK and
  other composed text no longer navigates away mid-word.
- Inline results are selected on `pointerdown` with the default prevented, so
  the popup can no longer close before a click is processed.
- The first `Escape` in the inline input closes the popup while keeping the
  query and focus, rather than immediately blurring.
- `aria-expanded` on the inline input now reflects popup visibility, including
  the loading, empty and error popups, instead of whether results happen to exist.
- Inputs have real accessible names via a visually hidden `<label>` rather than
  relying on the placeholder.
- Results retained while the next query loads are highlighted against the query
  that produced them (`resolvedQuery`), not the query being typed.
- `Enter` pressed on the dialog's Clear or Retry button activates that button.
  Result-navigation keys were previously handled for the whole dialog, so Enter
  anywhere inside it opened the active result instead.
- Focus is pulled back into the dialog if something outside it takes focus; a
  Tab pressed after focus escaped never reached the dialog's own handler.
- The body scroll lock is reference counted, so two open dialogs no longer
  unlock the page early or leave `overflow: hidden` behind, and an existing
  `!important` priority is preserved.
- Inline results are selected on `click` rather than on any `pointerdown`, so a
  right-click no longer navigates and a touch drag can still scroll.
- While the inline popup is closed, `aria-controls` and `aria-activedescendant`
  are omitted instead of referencing elements that are not in the DOM, and the
  popup no longer opens below `minQueryLength` with nothing to show.
- Live regions announce settled outcomes only. Announcing each debounced change
  queued one utterance per keystroke, and the error state was read twice —
  once by the status region and once by its `role="alert"` panel.
- `searchsocket add` refuses to write through a symlink or over a directory, so
  `--overwrite` cannot follow a link out of the target directory.
- Breadcrumbs use only the path of an absolute result URL, rather than turning
  the scheme and host into segments.
- A response that resolves after its request was aborted no longer overwrites
  newer state.

### Changed

- `searchsocket add` prints the entry component explicitly (with the `$lib`
  alias where applicable) plus theme and customization hints, instead of
  guessing from the first file written. It says so when existing files were
  kept, and does not describe a template it did not write.
- The template copier handles `.ts`, `.css` and `.svg` assets and nested
  directories, not just top-level `.svelte` files. Existing files are still
  skipped unless `--overwrite` is passed, per file — so adding a second
  component preserves any edits made to the shared files.

**Already-copied components are not modified.** These changes affect what
`searchsocket add` generates from now on; existing files in your project are
untouched, and re-running `add` skips them unless you pass `--overwrite`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-19

A stabilization release on the road to 1.0. Every change below fixes something
that was observably wrong, not merely untidy — several could destroy a
production index or expose unpublished content.

**Upgrading requires a full reindex.** Record identity changed, so 0.7.x records
are invisible to 0.8 rather than misread. Nothing is deleted: the new generation
is written alongside the old one, and `searchsocket migrate cleanup-legacy`
removes the old records once you are satisfied. See
[docs/migration-0.8.md](docs/migration-0.8.md).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** A full reindex is required. Record IDs now carry the schema
  version, project id, scope name, and record type, and all four are verified on
  every read.
- **Breaking:** The MCP endpoint requires an API key. Its auth check was
  previously skipped entirely when none was configured, so it served anyone. Set
  `mcp.handle.apiKey` or `mcp.handle.apiKeyEnv`, or it answers 503.
- **Breaking:** `mcp.enable` is now honoured. It defaults to
  `NODE_ENV !== "production"`, so a production deployment relying on the
  endpoint must set it explicitly.
- **Breaking:** Browser requests can no longer choose their scope. `?scope=`,
  and `scope` in a POST body, are refused with 403 unless listed in
  `api.allowedScopes`.
- **Breaking:** Browser search responses omit `routeFile` and `chunkText`, and
  page responses omit `routeFile`. Enable `api.exposeInternalFields` to restore
  them. `SearchResult.routeFile` is now optional.
- **Breaking:** `POST /api/search` requires `Content-Type: application/json`.
- **Breaking:** Filter values containing a quote or backslash are rejected with
  400. Upstash's filter syntax defines no escape sequence for either, so
  escaping them was a guess that could widen a query across tenants.
- **Breaking:** Project ids and scope names are restricted to
  `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, up to 80 characters. Relevant if you set
  `scope.sanitize: false`.
- **Breaking:** `searchsocket index` exits 5 when no vector backend is
  configured, instead of exiting 0. Pass `--allow-unconfigured` for the old
  behaviour.
- **Breaking:** `searchsocket clean --remote` is a dry run until `--apply`, and
  deletes a single scope. Project-wide deletion needs
  `--all-scopes --confirm-project <id>`.
- **Breaking:** Node 22.12 is the minimum. Node 20 reached end of life in March
  2026, and the CommonJS build needs unflagged `require(ESM)`.
- Per-page weights (`searchsocket-weight`, frontmatter) and
  `ranking.enableAnchorTextBoost` now affect ranking. Both were documented but
  inert in the default search path, so enabling them may shift your results.
- Chunk keys no longer depend on a chunk's position, so editing one section stops
  re-embedding the whole page.
- Search issues a bounded number of backend requests regardless of `topK`.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `search.dualSearch`, `search.pageSearchWeight`,
  `ranking.aggregationCap`, `ranking.aggregationDecay`,
  `ranking.minChunkScoreRatio`, `ranking.weights.aggregation`,
  `embedding.batchSize`, `embedding.images.enable`, and
  `chunking.weightHeadings`. All were tunable and documented; none had any
  runtime effect. Setting one now produces a migration error naming its
  replacement rather than being silently ignored.
- **Breaking:** `UpstashSearchStore` is no longer exported from the package
  root. Use `createUpstashStore(config)`.

### Added

- `searchsocket migrate cleanup-legacy` removes records written under an older
  index schema, dry-run by default.
- `api.allowedScopes` and `api.exposeInternalFields` for browser access policy.
- `upstash.batchSize` and `upstash.maxRetries` for request batching and
  transient-failure retry.
- `indexing.maxDeletionRatio`, plus `--allow-empty` and
  `--accept-large-deletion` on `searchsocket index`.
- `mcp.handle.apiKeyEnv`, so the MCP key need not be committed.
- `SECURITY.md` documenting the public/privileged split, and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` documenting the test tiers.

### Fixed — data safety

- An indexing run truncated by `--max-pages`/`--max-chunks`, or one that failed
  to fetch or extract a page, or whose source unexpectedly returned nothing, no
  longer deletes the records it did not see. Any of these could previously erase
  a valid production index.
- `clean --remote --scope X` resolved the scope flag and then dropped the entire
  project.
- `prune` fails closed when the remote branch list cannot be trusted (shallow
  clone, no remotes, empty scopes file), no longer treats an unknown timestamp
  as old, and requires a scope to be both orphaned and inactive by default.
- `listScopes` stamped `new Date()` on every scope, making TTL pruning
  meaningless. It reports the newest real `indexedAt`, or `"unknown"`.
- Force mode wiped the page namespace before re-upserting, so a crash between
  the two served an empty index. It now upserts first and deletes after.
- Custom records supplied through `customRecords` are no longer deleted by a
  site-only indexing run that does not mention them.

### Fixed — isolation

- Page IDs were raw URLs and chunk keys omitted the project id, while all
  projects shared two namespaces. Two sites in one Upstash index both serving
  `/docs` wrote to the same record.
- `getPage()` returned whatever the backend gave it without checking ownership.
- Project ids and scope names were concatenated into filter expressions
  unescaped and unvalidated.
- `git rev-parse` ran without a working directory, so `--cwd` read one project's
  config while resolving another repository's branch as the scope.

### Fixed — reliability

- Sixteen `catch {}` blocks returned empty results for every backend failure, so
  an outage was indistinguishable from an empty index. Failures are now typed
  and only a genuinely absent namespace reads as empty.
- Error messages reaching callers no longer carry raw SDK text, which can
  contain credentials.
- `listPages` returned whatever survived filtering one backend page, so a
  request for 50 could return 3 with no way to tell that from the end of the
  list.

### Fixed — security

- Any caller could select any scope via `?scope=` or a POST body.
- Browser search responses carried `routeFile` and `chunkText` to every caller.
- The MCP endpoint's auth check was skipped entirely when no key was configured.
- Crawl requests gained timeouts, response size caps, an accepted content type,
  and a same-origin redirect policy.
- External links were counted as internal, inflating pages' incoming-link
  ranking with links pointing at other sites.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Reject GET and DELETE requests to MCP endpoint with 405 to prevent SSE reconnect storms on serverless
- Allow `SearchEngine` to operate without Upstash credentials — returns typed `SEARCH_NOT_CONFIGURED` error instead of crashing

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Reduce MCP tool surface from 6 tools to 3 focused tools (`search`, `get_page`, `get_related_pages`)
- Remove `find_source_file` tool (redundant — `search` already returns `routeFile` in every result)
- Remove `list_pages` tool (LLMs should search, not browse; filesystem handles enumeration locally)
- Remove `get_site_structure` tool (same reasoning; too much context for LLM consumption)
- Rename `pathOrUrl` parameter to `path` in `get_page` and `get_related_pages` for LLM usability
- Rewrite all tool descriptions with cross-references, negative constraints, and parameter examples
- Add smart error recovery to `get_page` — suggests similar pages when requested page not found
- Return human-readable "no results" message from `search` instead of empty JSON
- Remove `outputSchema` from search tool to reduce token overhead in tool definitions

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- Remove `markdown` field from page vector metadata to avoid exceeding Upstash's 48KB metadata limit on large pages
- Reconstruct page markdown on demand from chunks via new `getChunksForPage()` method
- Add 30,000-character hard cap on `chunkText` in chunk metadata as a safety net

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- Gracefully skip indexing when vector backend is unavailable instead of crashing
- Upgrade to Node 24 for npm v11 OIDC support in publish workflow
- Switch publish command to pnpm with provenance
- Remove broken `npm install -g npm@latest` from publish workflow

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Use targeted `fetch()` for chunk content hashes instead of `range()` scan to avoid namespace cross-contamination on hybrid indexes
- Use `range()` scan for stale chunk ID detection (safe for deletion since removing non-existent IDs is idempotent)
- Reduce Upstash batch size from 100 to 90 to stay within API limits

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-03

- **`llms.txt` generation** — default `generateFull: true` and serve markdown variants
- **`.mcp.json` generation** — auto-generate MCP config during `searchsocket init`
- **Interactive CLI setup** — `searchsocket init` with auto-config injection
- **Copy-paste component recipes** — `searchsocket add` command for UI components
- **Search playground UI** — interactive search testing during dev mode
- **Search quality CLI** — `searchsocket test` command for MRR-based quality assertions
- **GET API endpoints** — REST endpoints for search, health, and page retrieval

- **Incremental page records** — content hashing for efficient re-indexing
- **Reactive Svelte 5 search primitives** — `createSearch` and `SearchSocket.svelte` for frontend

### Changed

- **Switched to Upstash built-in embedding** — use Upstash's native embedding via `data` field, removing external embedding dependency
- **Removed Gemini embedder** — dropped `@google/generative-ai` dependency and related config

- Handle missing Upstash credentials gracefully
- Prevent `apiPath` guard from bypassing `llms.txt` intercept

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Scroll-to-text navigation** — search result links now include `_sskt` (text target) and `_ssk` (section title) query params plus native `#:~:text=` fragments for smooth scroll-to-text on both SvelteKit client navigations and full page loads
- **Cross-node text matching** — TreeWalker-based text map concatenates all visible text nodes, enabling matches that span split DOM nodes (e.g. `<em>Install</em>ation`)
- **CSS Custom Highlight API** — non-destructive highlighting via `::highlight()` pseudo-element in modern browsers, with DOM mutation fallback for older browsers
- **Two-pass regex matching** — strict pass requires separators between tokens; lenient fallback allows zero-width separators for adjacent DOM nodes without whitespace

### Fixed

- Replaced fraction-based merge metric with single `maxDisplacement` check for more reliable result merging

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Support `pageWeights: 0` as a no-index signal to exclude specific pages
- Prioritise `og:title` and `h1` over `<title>` tag during content extraction

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Limit chunks per page sent to reranker for efficiency
- Include page description and keywords in reranker text for better relevance

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Page-level reranking** — reranker now receives assembled page documents (all matching chunks concatenated in document order) instead of individual chunk snippets, giving it a holistic view of each page's relevance
- **Stored chunk text** — full chunk markdown (up to 4000 chars) is now persisted alongside the snippet for richer reranking context
- **`ranking.minScore`** — configurable minimum absolute score threshold to filter out low-relevance results before they reach the client (default: `0`, disabled)
- **Link-discovery crawling for build mode** — `source.build.discover` enables automatic page discovery by crawling internal links from seed URLs, with configurable `maxPages` and `maxDepth` limits
- **Direct credential passing** — `embeddings.apiKey`, `vector.turso.url`, and `vector.turso.authToken` allow passing credentials directly in config instead of through environment variables
- **Dimension mismatch auto-recovery** — automatically detects and recreates the chunks table when switching to an embedding model with a different vector dimension

### Changed

- Replaced OpenAI embedding provider with Jina AI (`jina-embeddings-v3`) as the default and only provider; uses task-specific LoRA adapters (`retrieval.passage` for indexing, `retrieval.query` for search)
- Reranker uses Jina AI (`jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual`), sharing the same API key as embeddings
- Removed `openai` dependency

### Fixed

- Fixed TypeScript errors in test mocks (missing `dropAllTables` implementations)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-24

### Changed
